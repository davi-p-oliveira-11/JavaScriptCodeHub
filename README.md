## Basic User Interaction

At the introductory level, basic user interaction in JavaScript focuses on the foundational concepts of obtaining input from users and displaying output to them. It forms the basis for building interactive programs and understanding the flow of information between the user and the application.

Key Concepts:

Input Operations:

Input operations involve soliciting information from the user. In JavaScript, this is commonly achieved through the prompt function, which displays a dialog box asking the user for input.
Output Operations:

Output operations involve presenting information to the user. JavaScript utilizes the console.log function to output messages, data, or results to the console where users can view them.
Basic Interaction:

Basic interaction entails the exchange of simple information between the user and the program. This could include asking the user for their name, age, or any other pertinent details, and displaying messages or results based on that input.
Examples of Basic User Interaction:

Prompting users to enter their name or any other basic information.
Displaying a greeting message or acknowledging user input.
Conducting basic calculations or operations based on user-provided data.
Waiting for user confirmation or acknowledgement before proceeding.
Placement in Coding Challenges or Exercises:

Exercises in the "Basic User Interaction" category are ideal for absolute beginners who are just starting to explore programming concepts. These exercises provide a gentle introduction to interacting with users and understanding how information flows within a program.

In coding challenge repositories targeting beginners, exercises in this category serve as foundational stepping stones for learners to grasp the fundamentals of user interaction before delving into more advanced topics such as conditional statements and input validation.

### Example 1: 

Problem : "Sum of two"
Develop an algorithm that reads two integers and displays their sum.<br>
Example:<br>
Enter a value: 8 <br>
Enter another value: 5 <br>
The sum of 8 and 5 is equal to 13. <br>
