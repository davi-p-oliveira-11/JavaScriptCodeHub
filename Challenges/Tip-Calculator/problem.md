## Tip Calculator

Create a simple tip calculator. The program should prompt<br>
for a bill amount and a tip rate. The program must compute <br>
the tip and then display both the tip and the total amount of <br>
the bill.

### Example: 

What is the bill? $200 <br>
What is the tip percentage? 15 <br>
The tip is $30.00 <br>
The total is $230.00 <br>
